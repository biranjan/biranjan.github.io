      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just playing with Twitter API so that I could automatically like Tweets from certain twitter account like for example work. And then I realized
you can do quite more than just like the tweet. You can re-tweet the tweet, follow people, send messages and lot more.

      <description>Tables Tables are the inevitable part of every data scientist or analyst job. There will always be a situation where data can be best communicated by simply displaying them in rectangular boxes. In those situation I resort to a smart and versatile datatable from DT package.
library(DT) datatable(head(mtcars))  Okay if you think it comes with too may bells and whistle then herâ€™s a way to tune it down. And also by default datatable show 10 entries even though there is no 10 entries.</description>

The final outcome will look like this.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I like to know how am I doing with my expenses but my bank doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any application where I can break down my expenses.

However, my bank does provide a financial statement albeit in a not so helpful .txt format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Plotting Time Series Object There are lots of good plotting packages in R. And in this post I would like to show some of the interactive charting libraries to plot time series in R. If the object that you are trying to plot is a time-series object then one can plot it really easily.
 lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) str(lungDeaths) ## Time-Series [1:72, 1:2] from 1974 to 1980: 2134 1863 1877 1877 1492 .</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I wanted to start a blog in git-hub first I thought Jekyll was the only option. Although Jekyll is natively supported by git-hub however it is not the only static site that git-hub can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
