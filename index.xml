      <description>Plotting Time Series Object There are lots of good plotting packages in R. And in this post I would like to show some of the interactive charting libraries to plot time series in R. If the object that you are trying to plot is a time-series object then one can plot it really easily.
lungDeaths &amp;lt;- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths) str(lungDeaths) ## Time-Series [1:72, 1:2] from 1974 to 1980: 2134 1863 1877 1877 1492 .</description>

      <description>Intro When I wanted to start a blog in git-hub first I thought Jekyll was the only option. Although Jekyll is natively supported by git-hub however it is not the only static site that git-hub can handle. Fortuitously I stumbled into this article from www.rweekly.org. Since I do quite a lot of my work in R-studio it looked quite promising to me and I decided to use Hugo.The article explains all the concepts and also refer to great many other sources to get you started with Hugo and R-studio but the article mainly focuses on hosting the site in Netlify.</description>
